Parallel implementation of dynamic naive Bayesian classifier
## Accuracy 
Data sets based on [Toy Robot data set](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos402/hw/hw5/hw5.html)

|Data set type                   |Average success rate [%]|
|--------------------------------|------------------------|
|Discrete                        |65                      |
|Continuous                      |42                      |
|Bivariate                       |76                      |
|Gaussian mixture (without hint) |96                      |
|Gaussian mixture (with hint)    |99                      |

The average success rate means the average percentage of hidden states inferred correctly.

There are two main reasons for relatively low overall sucess rate:

1) Only about 90% of observed symbols are accurate
2) There are multiple transitions to hidden states with the same observed symbol
